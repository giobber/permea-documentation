# How to import and export omeka instances

Official documentation: [link](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/importexport/)

## Backup and restore between two omeka instances 
Omeka don't allow for a complete backup and restore routine, some steps are intended to be handled by the site administrator
- Additional modules and specific settings must be set before importing 
- Sites, Pages, Custom Vocab must be recreated manually
- Resource templates must be exported separately (see [this guide](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/content/resource-template/#import-a-resource-template))
- Item and Item sets can be moved via the [Item Importer module](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/ositemimporter/)
